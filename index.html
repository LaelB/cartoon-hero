		<h2>About Dolores</h2>
		<img src="img/Dolores_Madrigal.jpg" id="img1">
		<p>Dolores Madrigal is a supporting character in Disney's 2021 animated feature film Encanto. She is the eldest child and only daughter of Pepa and Félix Madrigal, and the older sister of Camilo and Antonio. She was gifted with enhanced hearing.</p>
		<p>In addition to being the niece of Julieta, Bruno, and Agustín, Dolores is also the cousin of Isabela, Luisa and Mirabel. In the early years of her life, Dolores lived in the nursery with her cousins Isabela, who is only a few weeks older than her, and Luisa who is two years younger than her. When Bruno was still with the family, Dolores apparently received a vision from her uncle who told her that the "man of her dreams" would be out of her reach because he would be engaged to someone else, causing her a great fear that would haunt throughout the years. When Isabela turned five and received her magical gift, she moved into her own room, and Dolores was left in the nursery with Luisa until her own fifth birthday a little while later. On the night of Dolores fifth birthday, she received the gift of enhanced hearing and she moved out of the nursery into her new room.</p>
		<p>Dolores has inside information on everyone in the family and "knows everyone's dirt" through her enhanced hearing, but she is always quiet and does not appear to be much of a gossip. She has a hard time keeping the secrets that she hears with her gift and has to cover her ears every time she hears noises that are too loud. Despite the negative view her uncle gave her when she was young, Dolores listened to Mariano Guzmán and learned more and more about him to the point of falling in love with Mariano. After the fall of the Casita, Dolores, with Mirabel's help, finally confesses her true feelings for him, which he corresponds, much to Mirabel and Isabela's joy. Dolores also confesses that unlike the rest of her family and the Encanto villagers, she was aware of Bruno still living in the Casita as she heard him every day.</p>
